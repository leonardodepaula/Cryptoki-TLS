# Cryptoki TLS

This repository aims to demonstrante how to establish a TLS context through a Hardware Security Module (HSM), also called cryptographic token, using the Rust Programming Language.

The code is highly experimental and only serves as a Proof of Concept (POC).

This work is inspired on the following repositories:
